# Example 348 — The safety net is load-bearing — and it is the only correct code in the pipeline

`the_safety_net_is_load_bearing.eml` measures what fraction of a pipeline's correct output arrives through the reconciliation pass rather than through the path that is supposed to produce it.

## EML

```eml
# Self-authored for the EML case corpus (no external origin). A filter that
# drops records it should keep, and a reconciliation pass that puts them back.
#
# The reconciliation pass was added months later, by someone who noticed
# records going missing and wrote a net rather than finding the hole. It works.
# The output is correct. Both facts are true at once, and the second one is why
# nobody went back for the first.
#
# The pass is also the slowest thing in the pipeline and it is described in the
# code as a safety net, which is a word that invites deletion. The question
# this program answers is not whether the net catches anything. It is what
# fraction of the correct output arrives through the net rather than through
# the path that is supposed to produce it.
#
# The two predicates are two implementations of one rule. Nothing declares
# which is right - the program runs both against the same records and reports
# where they disagree.
