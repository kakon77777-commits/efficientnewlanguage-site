# Example 546 — The latency was measured at the wrong end

`the_latency_was_measured_at_the_wrong_end.eml` - Three endpoints were changed to stream their results instead of building the whole response first. The latency dashboard recorded the best week it had ever seen. What the clients saw is computed below.

## EML

```eml
# Self-authored for the EML case corpus (no external origin). Three endpoints
# were changed to stream their results instead of building the whole response
# first. The latency dashboard recorded the best week it had ever seen. What
# the clients saw is computed below.
#
# Streaming was the right change and it did what it was supposed to do. A
# report that takes two seconds to assemble should not make the caller wait two
# seconds staring at nothing, memory no longer holds the whole body, and the
# first rows arrive while the rest are still being computed. Every argument for
# it is sound and every one of them is still true at the end of this file.
#
# The latency metric is recorded when the response begins, which is where a
# handler naturally has something to record: the moment it hands the first
# bytes to the socket. For an endpoint that writes its whole body at once, that
# instant is also the end, so the metric has been exactly right for years, on
# every endpoint, which is why nobody thought about which end it measured.
#
# Streaming is the change that moves those two instants apart. It improves the
# quantity being recorded and it is free to make the other one worse, and the
# other one is the one the caller is waiting for.

requests that exceed the client timeout

  successes, because the server did respond, promptly

control - the same three endpoints before they streamed
  gap between first byte and completion, before : 0 ms
  so the gap is not a property of these endpoints either
  it is a property of streaming, and it opened on the day of the change

why completion got worse and not just later
  before : one query, one serialisation, one write
  after  : one query per page, one write per page, and the client parses
           each page before the next arrives
  the work did not move, it was divided, and division has a per-piece cost
  report/summary : 800 ms to 1400 ms complete, 40 ms to first byte

Streaming was right: the first rows now arrive in 40 ms instead of 800.
The metric records the instant the response begins, which was the same
instant as the end on every endpoint until three of them streamed: the
dashboard improved 43 percent while timeouts went from 55 to 175 per minute.
