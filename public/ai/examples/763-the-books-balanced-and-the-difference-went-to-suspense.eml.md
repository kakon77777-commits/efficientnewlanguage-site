# Example 763 — The books balanced and the difference went to suspense

`the_books_balanced_and_the_difference_went_to_suspense.eml` - The daily reconciliation between the processor's settlement file and the internal ledger has balanced to the cent every day for four years. What balancing consists of is computed below.

## EML

```eml
# Self-authored for the EML case corpus (no external origin). The daily
# reconciliation between the processor's settlement file and the internal ledger
# has balanced to the cent every day for four years. What balancing consists of
# is computed below.
#
# The control is genuine. The reconciliation is run by a team that does not
# report to the one that books the transactions; two people sign every day; the
# match is to the cent rather than to a tolerance; and a day that does not
# balance stops the close rather than being carried forward.
#
# A line that cannot be matched is posted to a suspense account, and suspense is
# a ledger account like any other. Debits equal credits afterwards because the
# posting is what makes them equal.

    that books the transactions

  tolerance : none; the match is to the cent
  a day that does not balance : stops the close rather
    than being carried forward
  days balanced : 1461 of 1461
  verdict : BALANCED

  giving it to an independent team is the part almost
  nobody does, and it is why the 0 is worth reading

what balancing means here
  the claim : debits equal credits
  what happens to a line that will not match : it is
    posted to suspense
  is suspense a ledger account : yes, like any other
  so after the posting : debits equal credits
  what could make them differ : a line left unposted,
    which the close does not permit

  the residual has somewhere to go, and the place it goes
  is inside the sum being checked

  days balanced : 1461, unchanged
  suspense lines shown : 148000
  of those, aged past ninety days : 121000
  the reconciliation did not weaken; the account that
  absorbs the residual stopped being off the page

what a ledger that balances guarantees
  debits equal credits : exactly, to the cent, 1461 days,
    2 signatures, an independent team
  every transaction was understood : not addressed; a
    line nobody could explain becomes a balanced entry
    by being posted to suspense

an identity that a posting restores is restored by the
posting; what it cost is the size and the age of the
account that took the difference, and the daily report
does not carry either

An independent team signs the reconciliation twice a day, matching to the cent
with no tolerance, and 1461 days have balanced with 0 exceptions. Unmatched
lines are posted to suspense, which is inside the sum, so 6132 arrive and 900
clear each month - 148000 open, 8175 per ten thousand of them past ninety days -
across 0 reports that say so.
