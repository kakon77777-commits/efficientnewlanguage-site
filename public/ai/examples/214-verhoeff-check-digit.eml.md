# Example 214 — A checksum that notices order

`verhoeff_check_digit.eml` implements the Verhoeff check digit and measures the thing it does that Luhn cannot.

## EML

```eml
# Self-authored for the EML case corpus (no external origin). The Verhoeff
# check digit, and the class of error it catches that Luhn does not.
#
# Luhn (already in this corpus) catches every single-digit error and most
# adjacent transpositions - but not all of them: it misses 09 <-> 90, because
# both map to the same doubled sum. Verhoeff catches EVERY single-digit error
# and EVERY adjacent transposition, with no exceptions, by working in the
# dihedral group D5 instead of with sums.
#
# The construction is three tables and no arithmetic insight:
#
#   d[i][j]  the D5 multiplication table (not commutative - that is the point)
#   p[i][j]  a permutation applied by position
#   inv[i]   the inverse element
#
# Because D5 is non-commutative, swapping two adjacent digits changes the
# product. A sum-based scheme cannot do this: addition commutes, so a
# transposition that happens to preserve the sum is invisible to it.
#
# The program does not take that on faith. It exhaustively tries, over 40
# base numbers - every substitution and every transposition of each, which is
# what makes the claim exhaustive rather than sampled:
#
#   1. every single-digit substitution  - must be caught, all of them
#   2. every adjacent transposition     - must be caught, all of them
#
# and runs the same two sweeps against Luhn, so the difference is measured
# rather than asserted.
